## Best practices

### Prefer arrow functions as callbacks

As callbacks, [arrow functions](20201006111349-arrow_functions) have two
advantages over traditional functions:

-   `this` is lexical and therefore safer to use.
-   Their syntax is more compact. That matters especially in functional
    programming, where there are many higher-order functions and methods
    (functions and methods whose parameters are functions).
