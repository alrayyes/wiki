# Testing

## Code coverage

``` shell

```

## Race conditions

``` shell
go test -race

## Vetting

Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as
Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string. Vet
uses heuristics that do not guarantee all reports are genuine problems,
but it can find errors not caught by the compilers.

``` shell
go vet
```
