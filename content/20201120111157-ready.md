# Description

readcy[^1] creates a future that is immediately ready with a value.

Futures created through this function are functionally similar to those
created through `async {}`. The main difference is that futures created
through this function are named and implement `Unpin`.

# Declaration

``` rust
pub fn ready<T>() -> Ready<T>
```

# Notable traits

``` rust
impl<T> Future for Ready<T>
    type Output = T;
```

# Examples

``` rust
use core::future;

let a = future::ready(1);
assert_eq!(a.await, 1);
```
