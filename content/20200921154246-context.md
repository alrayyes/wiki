# Overview

Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines,
cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API
boundaries and between processes.

Incoming requests to a server should create a Context, and outgoing
calls to servers should accept a Context. The chain of function calls
between them must propagate the Context, optionally replacing it with a
derived Context created using WithCancel, WithDeadline, WithTimeout, or
WithValue. When a Context is canceled, all Contexts derived from it are
also canceled.

The WithCancel, WithDeadline, and WithTimeout functions take a Context
(the parent) and return a derived Context (the child) and a CancelFunc.
Calling the CancelFunc cancels the child and its children, removes the
parent's reference to the child, and stops any associated timers.
Failing to call the CancelFunc leaks the child and its children until
the parent is canceled or the timer fires. The go vet tool checks that
CancelFuncs are used on all control-flow paths.

Programs that use Contexts should follow these rules to keep interfaces
consistent across packages and enable static analysis tools to check
context propagation:

Do not store Contexts inside a struct type; instead, pass a Context
explicitly to each function that needs it. The Context should be the
first parameter, typically named ctx:

``` go
func DoSomething(ctx context.Context, arg Arg) error {
    // ... use ctx ...
}
```

Do not pass a nil Context, even if a function permits it. Pass
context.TODO if you are unsure about which Context to use.

Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes
and APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.

The same Context may be passed to functions running in different
goroutines; Contexts are safe for simultaneous use by multiple
goroutines.

See <https://blog.golang.org/context> for example code for a server that
uses Contexts.

# Googles take

> At Google, we require that Go programmers pass a Context parameter as
> the first argument to every function on the call path between incoming
> and outgoing requests. This allows Go code developed by many different
> teams to interoperate well. It provides simple control over timeouts
> and cancelation and ensures that critical values like security
> credentials transit Go programs properly.

# A saner take on this which I as a Go noob agree with

-   Context should go away for Go 2[^1]
