# Summary

| Quality Attribute | Definition                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Understandibility | The ease with which the design fragment can be comprehended                                                                                                 |
| Changeability     | The ease with which a design fragment can be modified (without causing ripple effects) when an existing functionality is changed.                           |
| Extensibility     | The ease with which a design fragment can be enhanced or extenended (without riple effects) for supporting new functionality.                               |
| Reusability       | The ease with which a design fragment can be used in a problem context other than the one for which the design fragment was originally developed            |
| Testabillity      | The ease with which a design fragment supports the detection of defects within it via testing.                                                              |
| Reliability       | The ease with which the design fragment supports the correct realization of the functionality and helps guard against the introduction of runtime problems. |
