# DNSCrypt

DNSCrypt[^1] is a protocol that encrypts, authenticates and optionally
anonymizes communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It
prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that
responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and havenâ€™t been
tampered with.

It is an open specification, with free and open source reference
implementations, and it is not affiliated with any company nor
organization.

Free, DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers are available all over the world.
