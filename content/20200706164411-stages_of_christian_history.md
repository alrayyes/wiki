When the ideal future envisioned by post industrialized, Western
democratic society is taken as the endpoint of history, the shape of the
narrative leading to here-and-now features something like the following
stages (as opposed to [the 10 stages of Islamic
history](20200706161134-stages_of_islamic_history)):

1.  Birth of civilization (Egypt and Mesopotamia)
2.  Classical age (Greece and Rome)
3.  The Dark Ages (rise of Christianity)
4.  The Rebirth: Renaissance and Reformation
5.  The Enlightenment (exploration and science)
6.  The Revolutions (democratic, industrial, technological)
7.  Rise of Nation-States: The Struggle for Empire
8.  World Wars I and II.
9.  The Cold War
10. The Triumph of Democratic Capitalism
