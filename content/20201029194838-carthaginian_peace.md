title: Carthaginian peace
---

A Carthaginian peace is the imposition of a very brutal "peace" achieved
by completely crushing the enemy.The term derives from the peace imposed
on [Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Carthage) by
[Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome). After the [Second
Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War), Carthage
lost all its colonies, was forced to demilitarize and pay a constant
tribute to Rome and could enter war only with Rome's permission. At the
end of the [Third Punic
War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Punic_War),the Romans
systematically burned Carthage to the ground and enslaved its
population.
