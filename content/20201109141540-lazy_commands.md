title: Lazy Commands
---

# Description

From [Symfony 4.0](20201109140137-symfony_4_0) commands are lazily
loaded. One broken command won't break all the other commands you have.
In order to lazy-load a command do the following:

-   Define command as a service
-   Add a `command` property to the `console.command` tag

# Syntax

``` yaml
app.command.complex_command:
  # ...
  tags:
    # the value of the 'command' attribute is the name of the command
    # (which is what the user needs to type in to execute it)
    - { name: console.command, command: app:my-command }

    # optionally you can define an alias for the command too
    - { name: console.command, command: app:my-command, alias: 'my-shortcut' }
```
