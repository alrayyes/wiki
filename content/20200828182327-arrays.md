title: Golang Arrays

Arrays are a thing in Go as well. Once initialized arrays cannot be
resized, if you're into **that** type of thing (no judgement) see
[slices](20200828182546-slices)

``` go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var a [2]string
    a[0] = "Hello"
    a[1] = "World"
    fmt.Println(a[0], a[1])
    fmt.Println(a)

    primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
    fmt.Println(primes)
}
```
