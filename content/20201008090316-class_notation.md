title: JavaScript Class Notation
---

# Introduction

By convention, the names of constructors are capitalized so that they
can easily be distinguished from other functions. Thanks to [ECMAScript
2015](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) above can be
achieved with a saner notation:

# Example

``` javascript
class Rabbit {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
  }
  speak(line) {
    console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
  }
}

let killerRabbit = new Rabbit("killer");
let blackRabbit = new Rabbit("black");

killerRabbit.speak("I want blood!");
blackRabbit.speak("For some reason I appreciate Tyler Perry movies");
```

If one **must** one can also use `class` in expressions:

``` javascript
let object = new class { getWord() { return "hello"; } };
console.log(object.getWord());
```
